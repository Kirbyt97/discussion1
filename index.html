           <h2>Homecoming</h2>
           <h3>The Structure of Homecoming</h3>
           <p>Homecoming begins by jumping back and forth between the present and five years in the past. Heidi, the interviewer, is working at Homecoming in the past, and is working as a server being questioned by the DOD in the present.</p>
           <p>	This narrative sounds much like a movie. The way the scenes jump back and forth without much notice resemble the way films can easily cut in and out of scenes.</p>
